 # Short Overview
 `check_lostfound.py` relies heavily on `make-lsLR.sh` and its generated files in order to be able to recover files from lost+found directory. That is: you need to run `make-lsLR.sh` every day to be able to restore files when that will ever happen. Otherwise the `check_lostfound.py` won't be able to work at all. 
 
 # Configuration
 Before using the script, have a look at the script! You'll need to adapt the script to exclude directories and change paths. It will *NOT* work out of the box for you! 
 
 # Important Note
 `check_lostfound.py` is still Python 2.x code and needs some adoption to Python 3.x code, but basically if you have the required files generated by `make-lsLR.sh` you can write a small shell script as well to restore the files. Actually, the Python script started as a shell script in its early life.
